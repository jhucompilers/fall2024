This page has links to the programming assignments, along with their due dates.

Please make note of our expectations for [design, coding style, and efficiency](assign/design.html).

All assignments are individual assignments unless specified otherwise.

**Very important**: The target platform for all assignments is x86-64 Linux,
and we will be using Ubuntu 22.04 for all autograding and testing.
It is essential that you have access to an x86-64 Linux development environment.
The ugrad and grad machines maintained by the CS department are an
excellent option if you don't have a personal machine that can run x86-64 Linux.
[Send me an email](mailto:daveho@cs.jhu.edu) if you need an account.

Note that you can install Ubuntu 22.04 from the Microsoft Store on a Windows computer,
and this is also can be the basis of an x86-64 Linux development environment.

We are not aware of any good way to set up a local development environment
on an M1 Mac. The ugrad and grad machines are probably your best option if
you have an M1 Mac.

Please see the instructors or CAs if you need help or advice on setting up a
development environment.
