# Example code

## Precedence climbing example

[prec-climb.zip](resources/prec-climb.zip) is an example implementation of precedence
climbing. The `Parser::parse_work` function in `prec_climb.cpp` is the implementation
of the algorithm. It's written in a purely-recursive way, which might make it easier
to understand than the pseudo-code in the
[Wikipedia article on precedence climbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator-precedence_parser).

Note that the lexer requires spaces between tokens. (E.g., `a+b` would be considered one
token, so you should type `a + b` instead.)

Example run (user input in **bold**):

<div class='highlighter-rouge'><pre>
$ <b>./prec_climb</b>
<b>a + b * 3 - 4 * 2 ^ b ^ 3</b>
OP_MINUS[-]
+--OP_PLUS[+]
|  +--IDENT[a]
|  +--OP_TIMES[*]
|     +--IDENT[b]
|     +--NUMBER[3]
+--OP_TIMES[*]
   +--NUMBER[4]
   +--OP_EXP[^]
      +--NUMBER[2]
      +--OP_EXP[^]
         +--IDENT[b]
         +--NUMBER[3]
</pre></div>

# Exam review materials

Note that in Fall 2020 the exams were take-home exams, so the format is
different than what you will see when you take Exam 1 in class.
However, the questions should still be useful for review purposes.
The Fall 2021 exams were in-person, and the questions are more representative
of the kinds of questions you will see in this course's exams.

* [Fall 2020 Exam 2](resources/exam02-628.pdf), [Solution](resources/exam02_soln.pdf) (Questions 1–5 are relevant)
* [Fall 2021 Exam 1](resources/exam01-fall2021.pdf), [Solution](resources/exam01-fall2021-solution.pdf) (All questions are relevant)

For Exam 2:
